# yesno

## Introduction

Provides a single function `yesno()` which asks a custom yes-no question with variable responses.

The order and phrasing of the possible responses varies randomly to ensure the user consciously chooses (as opposed to automatically types their response).

## Demonstration

```
yesno("Do you like ", R.Version()$nickname ,"?")
Do you like Bug in Your Hair?
1: Definitely
2: No way
3: No

Selection: 1
[1] TRUE

yesno("Do you like ", R.Version()$nickname ,"?")
Do you like Bug in Your Hair?
1: No way
2: Uhhhh... Maybe?
3: I agree

Selection: 2
[1] FALSE
```
